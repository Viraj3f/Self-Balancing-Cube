    "- Amend the various hyperparameters and network architecture to see if you can get your agent to solve the environment faster than this benchmark implementation.  Once you build intuition for the hyperparameters that work well with this environment, try solving a different OpenAI Gym task!\n",
    "- Write your own DDPG implementation.  Use this code as reference only when needed -- try as much as you can to write your own algorithm from scratch.\n",
    "- You may also like to implement prioritized experience replay, to see if it speeds learning.  \n",
    "- The current implementation adds Ornsetein-Uhlenbeck noise to the action space.  However, it has [been shown](https://blog.openai.com/better-exploration-with-parameter-noise/) that adding noise to the parameters of the neural network policy can improve performance.  Make this change to the code, to verify it for yourself!\n",
